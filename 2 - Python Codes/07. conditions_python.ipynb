    "\n",
    "Python supports a set of control flow statements that you can integrate into your program. The statements inside your Python program are generally executed sequentially from top to bottom, in the order that they appear. Apart from sequential control flow statements you can employ decision making and looping control flow statements to break up the flow of execution thus enabling your program to conditionally execute particular blocks of code.\n",
    "The term control flow details the direction the program takes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Sequential Control Flow Statements:** This refers to the line by line execution, in which the statements are executed sequentially, in the same order in which they appear in the program.  \n",
    "**2. Decision Control Flow Statements:** Depending on whether a condition is True or False, the decision structure may skip the execution of an entire block of statements or even execute one block of statements instead of other (if, if…else and if…elif…else).  \n",
    "**3. Loop Control Flow Statements:** This is a control structure that allows the execution of a block of statements multiple times until a loop termination condition is met (for loop and while loop). Loop Control Flow Statements are also called\n",
